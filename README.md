- 👋 Hi, I’m @julia-spriggs. I'm an American living in SW France.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to the free and open internet.
- 🌱 I just finished a bootcamp all about the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I'd be a good fit! I'd really like to hone my skills, so I'm open to most projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: email would be best. github at julia-spriggs dot fr.
