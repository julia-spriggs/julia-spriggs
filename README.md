- 👋 Hi, I’m @julia-spriggs. I'm an American living in SW France.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to the free and open internet.
- 🌱 I just finished a bootcamp all about the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where I'd be a good fit! I'd really like to hone my skills, so I'm open to most projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: email would be best. github at julia-spriggs dot fr.
- 💻 My projects:
1. First project: Kitten mittens game [repository](https://github.com/julia-spriggs/kitten-mittens-game). This was a project I made by myself within 5 days using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
2. Second project: Cocktail recipes [repository](https://github.com/Cocktail-recipes/cocktail-recipes). This was a project I worked on with one of my classmates within 5 days, using Javascript, MongoDB, Express, Node, and Bootstrap.
3. Final project: Furever friends [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/project3-ironhack/repositories). This was a project I worked on with one of my classmates within a week and a half, using Javascript, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
